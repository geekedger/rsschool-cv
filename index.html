            <h2>Summary:</h2>
            <p>I am currently a  part-time student at Belarusian State University, majoring in business administration. 
                For a past few years I have also been working at blockchain laboratory in Minsk. As a business analyst 
                and project-manager I often had to communicate with front-end and back-end developers as well as designers and SMM specialists.  
                In order to understand the development process better , I've started learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript and got carried away.
                
                As of now, I firmly decided to gain more experience in front-end development and  subsequently become a qualified specialist.  
                It is very important for me to be able to study, and most importantly, put into practice new knowledge.  
                I am looking to expand  my technical skills and it seems, that RS School is the right place to put effort to learn different 
                web technologies involved in software development.</p>
