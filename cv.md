  ## Summary: 
  ---
  I am currently a  part-time student at Belarusian State University, majoring in business administration. For a past few years I have also been working at blockchain laboratory in Minsk. As a business analyst and project-manager I often had to communicate with front-end and back-end developers as well as designers and SMM specialists.  In order to understand the development process better , I've started learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript and got carried away.

  As of now, I firmly decided to gain more experience in front-end development and  subsequently become a qualified specialist.  It is very important for me to be able to study, and most importantly, put into practice new knowledge.  I am looking to expand  my technical skills and it seems, that RS School is the right place to put effort to learn different web technologies involved in software development.
